In this little project I experiment on how to use Python Libraries from Julia (a high performing programming language for Data Science), and viceversa to check how both languages can coexist and leverage advantages of both from Python projects. Also, I compare performance benchmarks.

You can see how the code performs matrix multiplications using different techniques, and can compare its performance:
- Python time: 0.922 seconds
- Numpy time: 0.002 seconds
- Julia time (1st time): 3.058 seconds
- Julia time (2nd time): 0.026 seconds

Indeed a fun and interesting experiment!
